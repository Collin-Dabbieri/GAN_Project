# Here we're going to combine our argparse script with a convgan class to do a few things
# this will be able to either take premade training data or create training data given a glob-ready string, something like '../Final_Fantasy/*.mid'
# the argparse will contain all of the hyperparameters you could ever want
# it will train a GAN and output images and/or MIDI files periodically during training
